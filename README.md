# Predict-purchasing-at-Starbucks-app

## 1. Installation:
Python versions 3
Python Libraries:(Pandas, Scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib).


## 2. Project Motivation:
Starbucks is considered as one of the best coffee chains on the planet. It is likewise one of the pioneers to present its own reward applications in 2010. Clients can get limited time offers notices, by order and pay through the mobile app they earn reward for their transactions. Once every few days, Starbucks sends an offer to some users of the mobile app. An offer can be just an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or buy one get one free. This allows Starbucks to gather significant direct client data just as their transaction behaviors. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is this is what we want to solve with this data set. we have to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type, We want to build machine learning model to predict if the offers we be completed or not by only knowing his/her age, gender, income.
